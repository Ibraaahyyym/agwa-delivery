## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React Query / SWR  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express &/or NestJS, Socket.IO (or WebSocket), RESTful API  
- **Database:** MongoDB (primary), Redis (caching / pub-sub)  
- **Auth:** JWT, refresh tokens; OAuth optional  
- **Payments:** Integration-ready (e.g., Flutterwave, Paystack, Stripe)  
- **Hosting / Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render / Railway / AWS (backend)  
- **CI / CD:** GitHub Actions (recommended)  
- **Monitoring:** Sentry, Prometheus + Grafana (optional)

---

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS) >= 18  
- npm or yarn  
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)  
- Redis (optional, for caching/pub-sub)  
- Git

### Quickstart (clone & setup)
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/picka-platform.git
cd picka-platform
```

---

## Environment Variables

### Create .env files in server/ and client/ as needed. Example .env.example values:

#### server/.env
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/picka
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET>
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

#### client/.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=http://localhost:4000

---

## Run Backend
# from repo root
cd server
npm install
npm run dev      # or `npm run start:dev` depending on scripts

### Common backend npm scripts (put in package.json):

dev ‚Äî start server with nodemon

start ‚Äî production start

test ‚Äî run tests

lint ‚Äî run linter

seed ‚Äî seed DB (dev only)

---

## Run Frontend
cd client
npm install
npm run dev       # starts Next.js dev server on :3000 by default

Common frontend scripts:

dev ‚Äî local dev

build ‚Äî production build

start ‚Äî start production server

lint ‚Äî linting

test ‚Äî unit tests

---

## Run Mobile (optional)

#### If you add a mobile/ folder (React Native):
cd mobile
npm install
npx react-native run-android   # or run-ios

---

## API & WebSocket Endpoints (Examples)

#### These are sample endpoints to guide the API design. Add full API spec in docs/api.md or use OpenAPI/Swagger.

#### Auth

- POST /api/auth/register ‚Äî register customer/vendor/rider

- POST /api/auth/login ‚Äî login and receive JWT

---

#### Orders

- POST /api/orders ‚Äî create an order

- GET /api/orders/:id ‚Äî get order details

- PATCH /api/orders/:id/status ‚Äî update order status

---

#### Vendors

- GET /api/vendors ‚Äî list vendors

- GET /api/vendors/:id/menu ‚Äî get vendor menu

---

#### Riders

- GET /api/riders/available ‚Äî list available riders

- POST /api/riders/:id/assign ‚Äî assign order to rider

---

#### Realtime

- ws://<server>/ or wss:// ‚Äî socket namespace for order:update events and location:share

----

## Testing

##### Set up unit & integration tests for frontend and backend.

Backend (example)

cd server
npm run test

Testing frameworks: Jest + Supertest for API integration.

----

## Frontend (example)
cd client
npm run test

Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library.

---

## Linting & Formatting

Use ESLint + Prettier. Sample scripts:

"lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.ts,.jsx,.tsx",
"format": "prettier --write ."

Add GH pre-commit hooks (Husky) to run linters and tests.

---

## CI / CD

We recommend GitHub Actions workflows to:

- Run linting & tests on PRs

- Build & deploy on main merges

- Use environment secrets for production keys

---

Example workflow files go in .github/workflows/:

- ci.yml ‚Äî install, lint, test

- deploy.yml ‚Äî build & push to Vercel/Render/AWS

---

## Deployment Tips

- Keep environment-specific configuration in your hosting platform (Render, Vercel, AWS Secrets Manager).

- Use separate MongoDB instances for dev/staging/prod. Mongo Atlas is recommended.

- Use a CDN for static assets & image hosting (Cloudinary or S3).

- Monitor performance and errors (Sentry, Logflare, New Relic).

---

## Security

- Use HTTPS / TLS for all endpoints.

- Rotate keys and use short-lived tokens where possible.

- Validate and sanitize input on server side.

- Rate-limit public endpoints.

- Audit third-party dependencies with npm audit and Dependabot.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to hello@picka.ng (or create a private security issue) rather than opening a public issue.
